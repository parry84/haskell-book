    "# Chapter 13. Building projects\n",
    "## 13.1 Modules\n",
    "Haskell programs are organized into modules. Modules contain the datatypes, type synonyms, typeclasses, typeclass instances, and values you’ve defined at the top level.\n",
    "This chapter covers:\n",
    "* writing Haskell programs with modules;\n",
    "* using the Cabal package manager;\n",
    "* building our project with Stack;\n",
    "* conventions around project organization;\n",
    "* building a small interactive game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.2 Making packages with Stack\n",
    "* The Haskell Cabal is a package manager.\n",
    "* Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects.\n",
    "* Stack is built on top of Cabal.\n",
    "* Stack simplifies the process.\n",
    "* Stack elies on an LTS snapshot of Haskell packages from Stackage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.3 Working with a basic project\n",
    "* `stack build` builds the project.\n",
    "* `stack setup` installs the right LTS version of GHC.\n",
    "* `stack ghci` starts the GHCi REPL\n",
    "* `stack exec` run the built project\n",
    "\n",
    "The executable is defined by the `.cabal` file.\n",
    "## 13.4 Making our project a library\n",
    "A module can be defined as a library and added to the dependencies by adding its source path to `build-depends` entry.\n",
    "## 13.5 Module exports\n",
    "By default every top-level binding is exported. For larger modules is better to specify the exports.\n",
    "## 13.6 More on importing modules\n",
    "* Imported modules are top-level declarations.\n",
    "* The entities imported as part of those declarations have scope throughout the module, and they can be shadowed by local bindings. \n",
    "* The ordering of import declarations is irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of a module can be explored with `:browse`\n",
    "## 13.7 Making our program interactive\n",
    "Use the `do` syntax and `getLint` function\n",
    "## 13.8 `do` syntax and `IO`\n",
    "The `do` syntax is a syntactic sugar that allows to sequence _monadic_ actions.\n",
    "Is better to use `>>=` in single-line expressions instead of `do`.\n",
    "## 13.9 Hangman game\n",
    "Command `stack new` create a new project.\n",
    "## 13.14 Chapter exercises\n",
    "Changing the game so that, as with normal hangman, only incorrect guesses count towards the guess limit."
